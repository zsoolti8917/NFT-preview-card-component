## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 

### What I learned

i really loved this challange, it visually looks stunning in spite of that it is not that hard to recreate. I learned a lot about how the ::before and ::after pseudo elements work. It was fun to play with grid, placing the elements to their locations. I learned how to use the transform property, and how to use it with the transition property. Finally i remembered the importance of accesibility, and used Scott O'hara's [inclusively hidden code] (https://www.scottohara.me/blog/2017/04/14/inclusively-hidden.html) snippet to hide the text in the html, and make it visible only for screen readers.I tried to make my code as accesible as possible, altough i know that i still have a lot to learn about this topic. 

### Continued development

I added to the project a little zooming animation and i am happy with it, i don't plan to improve the code in the future.
